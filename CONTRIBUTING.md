I'm not crazy strict on the formatting of code, as long as it's both
consistent with the rest of the program and uses spaces. **No tabs please; your
code will be rejected.**

If there's a new feature you want seen, go ahead and make an issue for it. It's
probably a good idea to not work on a new feature until the issue has been
reviewed and is recognized as a useful feature.

If you see an issue you want to fix, go ahead and claim it if someone hasn't
already.

That's about it, beyond "don't be a jerk".
